# Fire-and-Water
My supercomputing project for 22-23. The title is based on "Fire and Ice". In this project I strive to create a model that simulates the effects of wildfires on hydrology.

Currently I have created both the hydrolic erosion simulation and a multi-processing script to increase preformace. I need to create a ground water absorption script and then intagrate these scripts together.
